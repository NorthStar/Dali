HIGH PRIORITY:
-> Namespace dali
-> Document broadcasting behavior
-> Make all imports, namespace, and includes follow same style throughout Dali
-> Scoped subtape / autobackprop disconnected components of graph
-> Stacked GRU

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
-> data/glove should have a generate script to download vectors.
-> Random weights init should take doubles, not template typename.
-> Improve NLP-Utils. Agree on common set of practices for all the examples.
-> visualizer - web frontend for error visualization (60% done)
-> remove gflags from core dali
-> dali cmake finder should conform to standard notation, the automagic finder that finds the dependencies + dali should still be there, but under different variable name.

LOWER_PRIORITY:
-> add performance test (e.g. num words processed in Language Model on GPU ~ 20,000 words/second)
-> implement Imagenet training
-> Proof of concept: load existing image net model from caffe
-> make machine comprehension dataset inline with other loading system
-> made n-d print visually closer to numpy's n-d print
-> Add warning or normalize assignments to temporaries created by ravel/slice/row_pluck etc.
   (e.g. follow Numpy convention of non assignable types)
-> make zlib optional
-> check for clang version



THE BIG REFACTOR:
- examples
- data
- visualizer

- tensor
- autodiff

- neuralnet

- figure out what to do with utils
